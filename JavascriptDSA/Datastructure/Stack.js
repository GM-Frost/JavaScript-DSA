/** STACK
* 
 -> The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of LAST IN FIRST OUR (LIFO)
 -> The last element inserted into the stack is first element to be removed
 -> Stacks are commonly used to implement undo and undo/redo operations
 -> A stack of platses -> The last plate placed on top of the stack is also the first plate removed from the stack
 -> Stack is an abstract data types. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.
 -> The stack data structure supports two main operations: Push (which adds element to the collection), Pop(Which  removes the most recently added element from the collection)
*/

/** STACK - (QUEUE)
* 
 -> The queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of FIRST IN FIRST OUT(FIFO)
-> THe first element inserted into the queue is first element to be removed
-> A queue of people. People enter the queue at one end (rear/tail) and leave the queue from the other end (front/head)
-> Queue is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model
-> The Queue data structure supports two main operations
 - Enqueue, which adds an eleement to the rear/tail of the collections
 - Dequeue, which removes an element from the front/head of the collection

/** QUEUE USUAGE

 -> Printers
 -> CPU Task scheduling
 -> Call back queue in javaScript runtime
